This is an online copy of my SuperSlicer profiles.

Feel free to download and modify the profiles for your own use.

By default, your profiles will be stored on a Windows machine here: C:\Users\<Windows-user-name>\AppData\Roaming\SuperSlicer

I have setup this directory as a GitHub repository by entering the folder as C:\Users\<Windows-user-name>\AppData\Roaming\ and the repo name as SuperSlicer. This will add the existing SuperSlicer files without altering the structure needed.

If you want to back up your profiles in the same way, please replicate my .gitignore file. The physical_printer folder in particular should not be shared, because the ini files within may contain sensitive information like your Octoprint API key.
